**Small runze** wandering in the ocean of knowledge, here is my [resume](https://hzaurzli.github.io/Resume/).

Here are some details to let you know:

- 🔭 I'm Small runze (David Runze Li), a PhD student in the College of Life Science and Technology in Huazhong Agricultural University, and continue to work.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with: Life science, Bioinformatic, Virome, if you have any question, pls let me know!

- 😄 My research interests are focused on developing **useful bioinformatics software to integrate data and mine valid information**. Current research interests focus on **the exploration of bactericidal agents in the microworld (phage)** , and **the genetic mystery of phage and host interaction from population perspective**. I am dedicated to advancing computational methods to promote the exploration of the microworld.
